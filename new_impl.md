# Core NEw Features

‚úÖ User authentication via JWT  
‚úÖ User-specific Binance API keys stored securely  
‚úÖ Market buy/sell trades via Binance (using ccxt package)
‚úÖ Automatic trading pair resolution (only USDC quote supported for now)  
‚úÖ OHLCV data fetching  
‚úÖ Minimalist DB setup with SQLite3

# Flow
On Server Startup
ccxt.loadMarkets() is called with Binance

We define a list of suggested symbols (e.g., BTC, ETH, LUNA, etc.)

Each suggestion is mapped to a valid market pair with USDC as quote

e.g. BTC/USDC, LUNA/USDC, ADA/USDC

If no valid pair exists for a suggestion, it is removed from the list

The final list of tradable suggestions is stored in memory

On Frontend Request
Chart Data:

FE calls /fetchOHLCV

BE fetches OHLCV from ccxt (no caching, no WebSocket for now)

Trade Execution:

FE calls /placeTrade with symbol + side + amount

BE:

Uses the user‚Äôs stored API key + secret

Finds the matching symbol/USDC pair

Places a market order with ccxt.createOrder()

## API Endpoints

### üîê Authenticated (JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

#### `POST /fetchBalance`

- Returns user's total USDC balance from Binance using ccxt

#### `POST /placeTrade`

- Place a market order
- Params:
  - `symbol` (e.g. "LUNA")
  - `side` ("BUY" or "SELL")
  - `amount` (in USDC)
- Logic:
  - Finds matching market like `LUNA/USDC` (appends USDC, they were already filtered)
  - Creates market buy/sell order via ccxt
  - Returns order info

#### `POST /fetchOHLCV`

- Params:
  - `symbol` (e.g. "LUNA/USDC")
- Returns latest OHLCV data

---

## DB (sqlite3)

Only one table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  api_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  api_secret TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## JWT Payload
{
  "user_id": "user-123"
}
Must be verified and decoded on every request to match with user in DB.

## Use Cases
‚úÖ Show user‚Äôs current USDC balance
‚úÖ Show chart (OHLCV) data on demand
‚úÖ Let user click "Buy LUNA" with fixed amount (e.g. 10 USDC)
‚úÖ Handle multiple users (API keys per user)
‚úÖ Hide all trading pair logic from frontend

## Checklist
 Set up Fastify server
 Add JWT middleware
 Create SQLite DB with users table
 On server startup: load markets and compile valid suggestions
 Implement /fetchBalance
 Implement /placeTrade (market only, USDC as quote)
 Implement /fetchOHLCV
 Add input validation + basic error handling
 Log trades and errors (console or file)



## Notes
Only Binance is supported now (ccxt instance uses Binance)
Only USDC quote is supported (e.g., "LUNA/USDC", not "LUNA/BTC")
No WebSockets or caching for now
No UI ‚Äì backend only
